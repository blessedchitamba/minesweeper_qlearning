# minesweeper_qlearning
machine learning algorithm that uses q learning to teach mine sweeper to collect mines and avoid super mines.
The animation starts with a set number of sweepers, mines, and supermines. The goal for each sweeper is to
collect the most number of mines and avoid supermines by performing learning iterations and updating its Q-table.
